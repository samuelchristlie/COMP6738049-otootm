## Case
In a typical school setting, one example scenario is a school with a total of ten classes, each of which is uniquely assigned to a different teacher. Each class comprises a group of five students, with a total student body of fifty students across the school. This class structure allows for individualized attention to be provided to each student, with a low student-to-teacher ratio fostering an environment conducive to personalized learning and academic growth. Additionally, this structure facilitates easier tracking of student progress and assessment, enabling teachers to better tailor their teaching methods to the specific needs of each class and student. Overall, this scenario highlights the importance of thoughtful classroom composition in promoting a productive and effective learning environment.
